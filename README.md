**Underwater Image Enhancement using Image Processing Techniques**  
📌 **Project Overview  **  
This project focuses on enhancing underwater images where visibility and color balance are often degraded due to poor lighting and scattering. The goal is to improve image quality using image processing techniques and evaluate the results with standard metrics.  
⚙️** Methodology**  
The enhancement pipeline includes:  
Histogram Equalization – to improve contrast.  
Gamma Correction – to adjust brightness and color balance.  
Denoising (Non-Local Means) – to reduce noise while preserving details.  
🖼️** Results**  
Side-by-side comparison of original and enhanced underwater images.  
Improved brightness, contrast, and visibility.  
📊 **Evaluation Metrics**  
The enhanced images were evaluated using:  
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) – measures quality improvement.  
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) – measures structural similarity with the original.    
🛠️** Technologies Used**   
Python  
OpenCV  
NumPy  
scikit-image  
Matplotlib
